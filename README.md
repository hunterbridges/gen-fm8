# FM8 Sega Genesis Collection

The FM8 Sega Genesis Collection brings the voices of 16-bit to your fingertips.

You need [Native Instruments FM8](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths-samplers/fm8/pricing/)
to use these patches.

I've done a bit of touching up to these patches, namely volume and octave
matching. Hopefully that makes the voices a bit more appropriate for general
purpose use.
